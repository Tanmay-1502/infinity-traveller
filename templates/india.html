  <center><strong>INDIA</strong></center>
</div>
<p>
  One of the oldest civilisations in the world, India is a mosaic of
  multicultural experiences. With a rich heritage and myriad attractions, the
  country is among the most popular tourist destinations in the world. It covers
  an area of 32, 87,263 sq. km, extending from the snow-covered Himalayan
  heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country
  in the world, India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by
  mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity.
  Fringed by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at
  the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of
  Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. As you travel the expanse
  of the country, you are greeted by diverse nuances of cuisines, faiths, arts,
  crafts, music, nature, lands, tribes, history and adventure sports. India has
  a mesmeric conflation of the old and the new. As the bustling old bazaars rub
  shoulders with swanky shopping malls, and majestic monuments accompany
  luxurious heritage hotels, the quintessential traveller can get the best of
  both worlds. Head to the mountains, enjoy a beach retreat or cruise through
  the golden Thar, India has options galore for all.
